        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p className="">
          ELEVATED LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. To us,
          “Property Management” not only includes the basic operation, control
          and oversight of real estate assets but it also means: developing
          strategies and taking actions to maximize property values and
          investment returns. This is what separates CREM Management from the
          rest; we are driven to find ways to reduce expenditures, expand
          revenue streams, harmonize tenant relations and take actions today
          that will create value tomorrow.
